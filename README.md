# Global page content

This plugin will allow any site in a WordPress Multisite network to have a "virtual" page titled **Privacy Policy** at the slug `{site-slug}/privacy-policy`.

It leans very heavily on [work done by Dave Jesch](http://davejesch.com/2012/12/creating-virtual-pages-in-wordpress/)\*.

\* As I write this, the linked page (and the root site `davejesch.com`) are throwing WSOD. Hopefully this is temporary.
